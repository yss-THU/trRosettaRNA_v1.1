# Instructions for training the neural network (RNAformer) in trRosettaRNA.


##Requirements
====

* [Python (>= 3.8)](https://www.python.org/downloads)
* [Pytorch (>=1.10)](https://pytorch.org/)
* [Einops](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops)
* [NPZ files storing the training set](https://yanglab.qd.sdu.edu.cn/trRosettaRNA/benchmark/training_npzs_light.tar.bz2)


##Usage
====

### Download the training set.
  
Before initiating training, make sure to download the LMDB files for the training set:
```
cd materials/
wget https://yanglab.qd.sdu.edu.cn/trRosettaRNA/benchmark/training_npzs_light.tar.bz2 --no-check-certificate
tar -xjvf training_npzs_light.tar.bz2/
cd ../
```

### Perform training.

For example, if you want to perform training on GPU card #0 and save the trained model to `output/`:
```
python train.py materials/npz_3633 output/ -gpu 0
```
This script encompasses an early-stopping schedule, selecting the model with the highest validation C3' distance accuracy.
Here, the distance accuracy is defined as the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the predicted and native distance maps.
